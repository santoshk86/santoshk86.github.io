This blog will explore practical techniques for:

- SQL Server performance tuning and index strategies
- Designing resilient, scalable data platforms
- Pragmatic AI for data engineering workflows

A simple example: analyzing a slow query with missing index hints.

```sql
-- Example: Investigate missing index
SELECT TOP 50
    q.database_id,
    q.[statement],
    q.avg_duration_ms,
    q.execution_count
FROM dbo.QueryStats AS q
WHERE q.avg_duration_ms > 500
ORDER BY q.avg_duration_ms DESC;
```

We'll pair metrics with reproducible experiments, aiming for outcomes that matter in production: lower latency, higher throughput, and predictable operations.
