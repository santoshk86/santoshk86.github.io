    Cloud Architecture & Distributed Systems Engineering
  </h1>

  <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    This section explores modern cloud architecture through a systems engineering lens, focusing on scalable, resilient, and production-ready platform design.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    The articles examine cloud-native patterns, microservices architecture, container orchestration, observability strategies, performance tuning, and cost–scalability trade-offs. Each post is grounded in practical implementation and real-world architectural decisions rather than theoretical overviews.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    Designed for engineers and architects, these writings provide structured insights into building distributed systems that are reliable, maintainable, and engineered for scale.
