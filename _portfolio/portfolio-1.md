  <h1 style="font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 20px;">AI Engineering & System Architecture</h1>

  <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    This section captures my applied work and structured thinking around Artificial Intelligence systems from an engineering and architectural perspective.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    The articles focus on production-grade AI implementation — model integration, inference pipelines, system scalability, observability, performance optimization, and architectural trade-offs. Rather than theoretical discussions, the content explores how AI capabilities are engineered into distributed, cloud-native systems at scale.
